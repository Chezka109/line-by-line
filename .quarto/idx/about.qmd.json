Line by Line is where I document this journey, sharing the ups and downs of my experiences with various coding projects.\n\nFrom debugging elusive errors to designing intuitive user interfaces, I take on each challenge with curiosity and persistence. In this blog, I explore not just the code itself, but also my thoughts and feelings about key programming concepts that both inspire and frustrate me. Balancing the logical world of software with the creativity of industrial design, I aim to bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake.\n\nWhether you're a fellow developer, a designer, or just someone curious about the coding process, I hope my experiences resonate with you.
