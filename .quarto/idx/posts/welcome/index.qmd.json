Read to learn more :)\n\nHey there! Welcome to Line by Line, a space where I’ll be sharing my coding journey as a sophomore double majoring in Software Engineering and Industrial Design. This blog is a personal project of mine, where I’ll document the challenges I face, the solutions I discover, and my thoughts on various coding concepts that shape my learning experience.\n\nAs someone who’s passionate about both the technical and creative aspects of problem-solving, I find that coding is the perfect intersection of those two worlds. It’s like solving a puzzle, but the pieces don’t always fit easily—and that’s where the real learning happens. Sometimes it’s frustrating, sometimes it’s exhilarating, but every step adds to my understanding and pushes me forward.\n\nIn Line by Line, you can expect to read about:\n\n- **Coding challenges** I encounter in my coursework and personal projects\n- **Reflections** on programming concepts that excite or confuse me\nDesign insights from my industrial design background and how they influence my approach to software\n- **Lessons** learned from trial and error, debugging, and exploration in tech\n\nWhether you’re just starting out with coding, a fellow student, or someone who enjoys learning about the thought process behind writing code, I hope you find something relatable or inspiring in these posts.\n\nThis blog isn’t just about documenting success—it's about sharing the journey, with all its highs and lows. After all, coding is an ever-evolving process, and I’m here to capture it line by line.\n\nThanks for stopping by, and I hope you’ll stick around as I dive deeper into the world of software development!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nWelcome to my very first blog post!
