Hi, I'm Chezka (chess-ka) Quinola, a sophomore double majoring in Software Engineering and Industrial Design here in sweet Meadville, PA. My academic journey is a blend of technical precision and creative design, which influences the way I approach coding challenges and problem-solving. Line by Line is where I document this journey, sharing the ups and downs of my experiences with various coding projects.

From debugging elusive errors to designing intuitive user interfaces, I take on each challenge with curiosity and persistence. In this blog, I explore not just the code itself, but also my thoughts and feelings about key programming concepts that both inspire and frustrate me. Balancing the logical world of software with the creativity of industrial design, I aim to bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake.

Whether you're a fellow developer, a designer, or just someone curious about the coding process, I hope my experiences resonate with you. Line by Line is not just a technical blog; it's a personal reflection on learning, creating, and navigating the ever-evolving world of software and design.
